# Flashloan Exploits in Blockchain: Learning from Past Incidents

### The Bzx Protocol Incident
In 2020, Bzx Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, experienced a flashloan attack. A flashloan is a form of cryptocurrency loan that occurs instantly, without requiring collateral, and must be repaid within a single transaction block. Taking advantage of a vulnerability in the Bzx Protocol's smart contract, the attacker secured a substantial flashloan.

Executing a sophisticated series of transactions, the attacker manipulated the price oracle to artificially inflate the value of specific assets. This tactic enabled them to collateralize their flashloan with less value than stipulated. Concurrently, the attacker borrowed a significant sum from Bzx, using these undervalued assets as collateral. With the borrowed funds, they conducted trades, capitalizing on the distorted market conditions.

The Bzx Protocol hack underscored the critical importance of secure smart contract development and the necessity for robust risk management mechanisms in DeFi platforms. Following the incident, Bzx implemented additional security measures to prevent similar exploits, such as enhanced auditing and the integration of decentralized oracles for more accurate pricing.


### The Value DeFi Incident
In another flashloan attack in 2020, the decentralized finance platform Value DeFi fell victim to a breach. Exploiting a vulnerability in the platform's smart contract, the attacker manipulated the system to profit from the flashloan.

The attacker secured a substantial sum of cryptocurrency through a flashloan and used it to manipulate the value of a specific token on the platform. By creating artificial demand and supply imbalances, the attacker caused the targeted token's price to deviate significantly from its actual market value. This manipulation allowed them to execute trades at favorable rates, resulting in profits.

Value DeFi responded to the incident by enhancing the security of its smart contracts and implementing additional checks to prevent similar exploits. This incident highlighted the ongoing importance of security audits and proactive measures to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols.
